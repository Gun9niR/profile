    <h3>Academic Status</h3>
    There are many courses in college that I'm totally not interested in but forced to take, i.e. courses that don't have much to do with programming. 
    However, I still try to do well in them to secure more resources for myself and prove myself a good learner.
    As for the courses I care about, I spare no effort on them.
    <ul>
        <li>First year GPA: 91.74 (1/101)</li>
        <li>A+ courses (major related)</li>
        <ul>

    <h3>Projects</h3>
    I believe in the famous saying <em>"What I cannot create, I don't understand.".</em> Doing toy projects is great fun for me, which helps me learn efficiently.
