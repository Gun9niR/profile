        <p>I'm David Guo, a video game addict, if not a fan for coding.</p>
        <P>By the way, I sing. Went on stage with over 1k audience a few times, you can even search the video if you think you can find it. </P>
        <p>But I've quitted on-stage performance because not everyone is worth singing to.</p>

    <h3>Academic Status</h3>
    There are many courses in college that I'm totally not interested in but forced to take, i.e. courses that don't have much to do with programming. 
    However, I still try to do well in them to secure more resources for myself and prove myself a good learner.
    As for the courses I care about, I spare no effort on them.

        <li>First year GPA: 91.74 (1/101)</li>

    <h3>Projects</h3>
    I believe in the famous saying <em>"What I cannot create, I don't understand.".</em> Doing toy projects is great fun for me, which helps me learn efficiently.
